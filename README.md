# ByteLearn Backend API
This is the backend of the ByteLearn project, which is developed with Spring Boot.

**Frontend Repository: [ByteLearn Frontend](https://github.com/ericcasane/ByteLearn-Frontend)**

**Frontend Link: [ByteLearn Frontend](https://bytelearn-platform.vercel.app/)** (It actually doesn't work correctly because the backend is not deployed in a server.)

**Project Video: [ByteLearn Video](https://youtu.be/vFWb5POg2_k)**

## Features

1. **Authentication**: The API uses a token-based authentication scheme (Bearer Authentication).
2. **Security**: The API uses Spring Security annotations to protect endpoints and limit access based on roles and authorities.
3. **Swagger**: The API uses Swagger annotations for API documentation.
4. **REST Controllers**: The API provides several REST controllers to handle different entities, including:
    - Courses
    - Categories
    - Languages
    - Lessons
    - Orders
    - Enrollments
    - Reviews
    - Users
5. **CRUD Operations**: The API allows CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on various entities.
6. **Pagination**: The API supports pagination of results.
7. **Filtering and Search**: The API allows filtering and searching courses by title, description, language, and category.
8. **Role and Privilege Management**: The API allows management of user roles and privileges.
9. **Enrollment and Review Management**: The API allows users to enroll in courses, complete lessons, and leave reviews.
10. **Order Management**: The API allows users to create orders.

Please note that this is a general list based on the provided code snippets. For a complete and detailed list of features, I would recommend reviewing the full API documentation with SwaggerUi and source code.
